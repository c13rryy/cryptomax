                            To list an NFT for sale, our team will first of all approve the content to make sure it’s appropriate for listing. 
                            This process usually takes 4-8 hours. Upon successful approval, your NFT will list immediately on the Marketplace as either an auction or fixed price sale, 
                            according to your preference. 
                            Alternatively, you can also choose to list your NFT at a fixed time (with a minimum of 12 hours after approval).
